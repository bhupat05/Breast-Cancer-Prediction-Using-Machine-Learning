# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project is a part of a guided course on Coursera and focuses on building a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either **malignant** or **benign**.


## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

## Key Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading**: 
2. **Data Cleaning**: 
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
4. **Data Preprocessing**: 
5. **Model Building**: 
6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

##  Results
The logistic regression model achieved high accuracy in classifying tumors, making it a reliable baseline method for breast cancer prediction.
